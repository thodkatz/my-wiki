Is working experience different than programming projects, right? For sure. Freelancing and volunteering, teaching is part of the work experience.

# Milestones for a good resume

- If you love what you do, you should probably teach it to others. Trying to spread the knowledge, educate people. Teaching is fundamental. STEM programms is a must! It can show that you have soft skills and you probably understand what you are talking about!
- Reviews. Either from customers or academia professors or other notable persons.
- Of course real hard skill and soft skills that can be identified by the amount of work that you put to build stuff and to do stuff.
- Sometimes for certain positions, leadership skills is also a must. Organizer, coordinator, ceo and founder is a great plus.

# Question

- How do you certify what you are doing? By the name that you are using? For example in stackexchange or github, gitlab if you have a nickname, how do someone know if it is really you?
