# Why I am creating a such a plain wiki?

I am trying to find out the best solution about note taking. Wiki style, other things, which method, academia, but something fast and easy, which markup and so on. Actually I should probably note what kind of utilities I want my note-taking workflow software to have. But this is just a try to use vscode with just plain folders and files. Without any kind of wiki utility. Just folders, the tree view of vscode and markdown. Nothing fancy. Let's see how it goes... I mean you can use vim with nerdtree. But I dont like so much the aesthetic aspect and also I cant configure the instant markdown preview. I have accomplished it only with latex... BUt eventually vim is the answer.

Note taking, journaling, flashcards and so on (hand writing too) are essential tools for our learning and our memory. We are bloated with so much information every time. We need to document stuff.

I will use also git version control for this wiki and let's see how will go!

Cool features I like to see in my note-taking setup:

- Flashcards
- Uni notes
- Markdown syntax or find something more convenient. The better to combine markup, using latex for maths for example
- tree view of notes
- Probably I should use wikimedia and I need to search more about self hosted, servers and so on
- Black theme
- Automation
- Establish a standardized way of naming folders, files 
- Use git for the timestamp thing also and stop spreading across the globe dates!
  
VScode cons for note taking:
- spell checking is mostly for coding. How to enable greek spell checker?
